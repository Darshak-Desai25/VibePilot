  Usage
 - Add posts to your content queue (CSV/JSON or UI if provided).
 - Tune schedules and engagement rules in config.yaml or .env.
 - Monitor logs for actions taken and adjust rate limits to stay compliant.

  Extending
- Implement a new adapter in adapters/<platform>.py with methods:
authenticate()
post(content)
like(criteria)
comment(criteria, template)

- Register your adapter in the factory and add config entries‚Äîdone.

Roadmap (suggested)
- Web dashboard (Next.js) for queues, calendars, and logs
- Template variables (e.g., {day}, {hashtag}) and A/B post testing
- Native retry/backoff + platform-specific rate-limit handling
- Built-in content calendar import (CSV/Notion/Google Sheets)
